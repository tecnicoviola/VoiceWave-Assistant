# Virtual Voice Assistant

## 🎯 Project Overview
### Objective:
Develop a smart and interactive virtual voice assistant capable of understanding and responding to voice commands. This AI-powered assistant can perform tasks such as:
- Answering general knowledge questions
- Setting reminders
- Playing music
- Fetching weather updates
- Controlling smart home devices (optional)

## 🏗️ Key Components
### 🎙️ Speech Recognition:
- Uses **SpeechRecognition** library to convert spoken language into text.
- Captures voice commands via microphone input.

### 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Uses **nltk** or **spaCy** to process and understand user queries.
- Implements intent recognition to determine the user's needs.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS):
- Converts text responses into speech using **pyttsx3** or **gTTS**.
- Provides an audible reply to enhance interactivity.

### 🛠️ Functionality Modules:
- **🌤️ Weather Module:** Retrieves live weather data via OpenWeatherMap API.
- **⏰ Reminder Module:** Allows users to set and manage reminders.
- **🎵 Music Control:** Integrates with local playlists or services like Spotify.
- **🔎 Web Search:** Uses **requests** library to fetch online information.

### 🖥️ User Interface (Optional):
- GUI using **Tkinter** or a web interface with **Flask/Django**.

## 🔄 Example Workflow
1. **Wake Word Detection:** Listens for a specific wake word (e.g., "Hey Assistant").
2. **Voice Command Recognition:** Captures the user’s voice input.
3. **Processing the Command:** NLP analyzes the intent of the command.
4. **Executing Actions:** The assistant performs the requested task.
5. **Responding:** Provides a response via synthesized speech.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, nltk, requests, etc.
- **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap, Spotify API (for music control)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 nltk requests Flask
```

### Running the Assistant:
```sh
python voice_assistant.py
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add AI-powered **context-awareness** for better conversations.
- Enhance **smart home** integration (IoT compatibility).
- Introduce **multi-language support**.
